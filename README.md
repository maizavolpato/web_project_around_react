Sprint 13:
In this sprint, we continued working on the design of a website that allows the user to turn it into their online “photo album.” The same project that was previously developed only with JavaScript is now being converted into a website built with React. In this first stage, we added pop-ups to display the user’s name and description, to add a new photo, a pop-up that enlarges the photo when clicked, and also the button functionality to delete the card. Everything was created using React.

Sprint 14:
In this part of the project, the components were connected to the API. Therefore, everything seen on the website comes from an external server. The user is then able to add and delete photos from the server, change the name and description, and also change the profile picture if they wish.
