Sprint 13:
In this sprint, we continued working on the design of a website that allows the user to turn it into their online “photo album.” The same project that was previously developed only with JavaScript is now being converted into a website built with React. In this first stage, we added pop-ups to display the user’s name and description, to add a new photo, a pop-up that enlarges the photo when clicked, and also the button functionality to delete the card.
