Sprint 13:
In this sprint, we continued working on the design of a website that allows the user to turn it into their online “photo album.” The same project that was previously developed only with JavaScript is now being converted into a website built with React. In this first stage, we added pop-ups to display the user’s name and description, to add a new photo, a pop-up that enlarges the photo when clicked, and also the button functionality to delete the card. Everything was created using React.

Sprint 14:
In this stage of the project, the components were integrated with the API, so all of the content displayed on the website now comes from an external server. Users can add and delete photos on the server, update names and descriptions, and also change their profile picture if they wish.
